                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Vinnie, and I graduated with a BSc in Biology from Newcastle University in 2023. <br> 
                    I am now pursuing a career in Software Engineering. Although my academic background is in science, my interest in programming was ignited during my final year at university. 
                    I conducted a research project where I used Deep Learning to investigate food preferences in birds. With only a basic understanding of programming and artificial intelligence, 
                    I spent six months gathering data and building an image classification model that significantly streamlined the process of identifying bird species. <br>

                    After graduating, I worked as a personal banker at NatWest Bank while considering my long-term career goals. It was during a sabbatical spent backpacking through Asia and Oceania that I decided to pursue programming. 
                    Meeting many travelers who worked as Software Engineers, Data Analysts, and Web Developers inspired me to want a similar career that would allow me to work and travel. <br>
                    
                    Since then, I have been working on personal projects to enhance my programming skills.</p>

                    <p>The web page you are currently viewing! I'm currently taking a web development course with Udemy, and this is the overall output so far. Source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/chowvb/html-portfolio" target="_blank">here.</a> <br>
                    Hopefully with the the skills I learn on this course I can further develop my professional portfolio website and showcase my new skills. So far in this course I've learnt the basics in HTML and CSS.</p>

                    <p>Combining all of my favorite things into one project. Programming, Football and Video Games. <br> 
                        Football Manager is a popular football simulation game that allows players to take on the role of a manager, where players make critical decisions on tactics, transfers, training schedules among many other things to strive for success. <br>
                        A current project where I manage my favorite football club Liverpool FC, and simulate life after Jurgen Klopp. The aim of this project is to use data analysis to 
                        summarise my teams performance over the course of the football season to make informed decisions on transfer decisions (Selling/Buying Players). So far in this project I have completed one season of analysis and I'm soon to start the second season. <br>
                        The analysis and decisions are documented in a seperate website where similar to the Web Portfolio I'm aiming to style and develop an interactive website where you can follow my progress.

                    <p>My research was titled: <br> Using Deep Learning to Investigate Food Preferences in Small UK Garden Birds During Winter. <br><br> 
                    In this project I aimed partially automate the data collection and analysis as part of my thesis. I created an Image Classification model using Keras and TensorFlow to automatically classify species of birds based on images. <br>
                    The model was trained on 30,000 images that were prelabelled on iNaturalist (A citizen science database). I improved my image classification model by Microsoft's MegaDetector which is an object detection model. 
                    Using MegaDetector I extrated the bounding-boxes surrounding the birds identified in the training data and cropped them. Doing this allowed me to improve the accuracy of my image classification model, as the model would learn the specificitys of the birds rather than the background in the bird images. <br>
                    I then used my newly trained model on my data (Images I collected) to then classify the species of birds in my research field. <br>
                    Applying MegaDetector and my image classification model, I automated the filtering and classification of 41,371 images collected during my research project. This process took roughly 5 hours to complete on my home PC, in comparison to 40 hours it would take to manually classify each image. <br>
                    Whilst no new findings were discovered in this thesis, the application of Computer Vision in Ecology could significantly improve data processing and decision making in Ecology.</p>
