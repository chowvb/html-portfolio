                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My names Vinnie, I'm a recent BSc Biology graduate at Newcastle University (2023) persuiting a career in Software Engineering. Why persuit a career in tech and not science? <br>
                In my final year at Newcastle University, I conducted a reasearch project invesigating food preferences in birds using Deep Learning. This project sparked my interest in programming and the real world applications of it. <br>
                With very basic knowledge of programming let alone artificial intelligence, I spent 6 months gathering data and building an image classification model to assist in my research. <br>
                The project was a huge success with the Image Classification saving me hours by using the image classification model to identify species of birds rather than manually identifying species. <br>
                
                Post-Graduation I continued to work at NatWest Bank as a personal banker whilst I pondered what my long term aspirations were. It wasn't until I took a sebattical to backpack Asia/Oceania where I realised 
                that I wanted a career in programming, meeting so many travellers who work as Software Engineers, Data Analysts and Web Developers whilst travelling inspired me to want to do the same. <br> <br>
                
                Below you will can some personal projects that I have embarked on to hone my programming skills.</p>

                    <p>The web page you are currently viewing! I'm currently taking a web development course with Udemy, and this is the overall output so far. Source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/chowvb/html-portfolio" target="_blank">here.</a> <br>
                    Hopefully with the the skills I learn on this course I can further develop my professional portfolio website and showcase my new skills. So far in this course I've learnt the basics in HTML and CSS.</p>

                    <p>Combining all of my favorite things into one project. Programming, Football and Video Games. <br> 
                        Football Manager is a popular football simulation game that allows players to take on the role of a manager, where players make critical decisions on tactics, transfers, training schedules among many other things to strive for success. <br>
                        A current project where I manage my favorite football club Liverpool FC, and simulate life after Jurgen Klopp. The aim of this project is to use data analysis to 
                        summarise my teams performance over the course of the football season to make informed decisions on transfer decisions (Selling/Buying Players). So far in this project I have completed one season of analysis and I'm soon to start the second season. <br>
                        The analysis and decisions are documented in a seperate website where similar to the Web Portfolio I'm aiming to style and develop an interactive website where you can follow my progress.
